Overview of the Project: 

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. 
The agent receives rewards for actions that bring it closer to its goal and penalties for actions that are less optimal or harmful.

Key Concepts:
Q-learning: An off-policy RL algorithm where the agent learns the value of taking actions in certain states and updates values using the Bellman equation.
Exploration vs. Exploitation: The agent balances exploring new actions to learn about the environment and exploiting known actions to maximize rewards.
Discount Factor (gamma): Used to weigh future rewards less than immediate rewards.
Notes:
This example is simple and designed for a grid-based game like FrozenLake. For more complex games (e.g., Atari or continuous control tasks), you would typically use Deep Q-Learning (DQN) or policy gradient methods with deep learning models.
